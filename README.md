# Installation
Simply download the dll provided in the releases section of this repo and move it to the rml_mods folder on your Headless server.

**HIGHLY RECOMMENDED:** Download the companion pre-patcher [Cumulo](https://github.com/RileyGuy/Cumulo) to install the required tweaks, which will also install the latest bundled version of Nimbus alongside it.
